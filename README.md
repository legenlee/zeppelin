# Zeppelin

Zeppelin is third-party Minecraft Launcher which is developmenting with electron.

## You should have to know

Core engine you can call to `zeppelin-core` is my first goal to implement and reinforcement. GUI and main process of the application will be implemented after that. I think it may took a long time to complete.

## Roadmaps

- [ ] Displaying available Minecraft versions
- [ ] Installing assets and libraries required to launch Minecraft
- [ ] Launching Minecraft
- [ ] OAuth2 login (Microsoft only. Mojang and Legacy is not supported since Microsoft decided to deprecate them.)
